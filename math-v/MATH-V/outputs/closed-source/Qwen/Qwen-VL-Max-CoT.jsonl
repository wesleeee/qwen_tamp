The area of a shape is the amount of space inside that shape.\n\n1. Shape A: This shape is a triangle with three sides. To find the area of a triangle, we can use the formula: Area = (base * height) / 2. In this case, the base is 4 units and the height is 3 units. So, the area of Shape A is (4 * 3) / 2 = 6 square units.\n\n2. Shape B: This shape is a trapezoid with two parallel sides.

Shape E: This shape is a rhombus with four sides. To find the area of a rhombus, we can use the formula: Area = (1/2) * (product of the diagonals).

Since they both start at point A and move in the same direction, they will meet at point A again when Ahmed has completed an additional number of rounds compared to Sara, and vice versa.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that the square garden has a side length of 5m, so its perimeter is 20m. The rectangular garden has a width of 5m and a length of 10m, so its perimeter is 2 * (5m + 10m) = 30m.\n\nSince Ahmed walks around the square garden and Sara walks around the rectangular garden, their speeds are different because the perimeters of the gardens are different. To find out how many rounds Ahmed has to walk to meet Sara at point A again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the perimeters of the two gardens.\n\nThe LCM of 20m and 30m is 60m. This means that Ahmed and Sara will meet at point A again after they have collectively walked a total distance of 60m.\n\nSince Ahmed walks around the square garden, he completes one round every 20m.

To find the ratio of the area of the grey triangle to the area of the square, we need to express both areas in terms of $AB$.\n\nSince $AM = MN$, we can write the area of the grey triangle as $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AM \\cdot MN = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot AB^2$.\n\nThe ratio of the area of the grey triangle to the area of the square is then $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot AB^2}{AB^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) $3: 16$.", "model_answer": "d3:16", "correct": false}

{"id": "1103", "model": "qwen-vl-max", "response": "Let's consider the possible sums of pairs of numbers from 1 to 9, which can be obtained by adding two numbers from this set. Since there are 9 numbers, there are $\\frac{9 \\cdot 8}{2} = 36$ such sums, ranging from 2 to 18. However, since the number 10 is not included, we need to subtract 10 from each of these sums. This gives us the set of possible sums as 2-18-10 = \\{-8, -7, -6, \\ldots, 8, 9\\}. Since the number on each edge is the sum of the numbers on the two vertices which are connected by that edge, and the number on edge $A B$ is 9, we know that the numbers on vertices $A$ and $B$ must add up to 9. Therefore, the possible pairs of numbers for $A$ and $B$ are (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), and (4,5). Now let's consider the other edges. Edge $A C$ must have a sum of 9 + x, where x is the number on edge $C D$. Similarly, edge $B C$ must have a sum of 9 + y, where y is the number on edge $A D$. Since the numbers on each vertex are unique, we can use the information we have to determine the possible values of x and y. Let's start with edge $A C$. The possible pairs of numbers for $A$ and $C$ are (1,8+x), (2,7+x), (3,6+x), and (4,5+x). Since the sum of the numbers on $A$ and $C$ must be 9 + x, we can eliminate any pairs that do not add up to 9 + x. For example, if x = 1, then the only possible pair for $A$ and $C$ is (1,10), which does not add up to 9 + 1 = 10. Therefore, we can eliminate x = 1 as a possibility. We can repeat this process for each possible value of x, until we find the value of x that gives us a valid pair for $A$ and $C$. Similarly, we can use the information we have about edge $B C$ to determine the possible values of y. Let's start with edge $B C$. The possible pairs of numbers for $B$ and $C$ are (2,7+y), (3,6+y), (4,5+y), and (5,4+y). Since the sum of the numbers on $B$ and $C$ must be 9 + y, we can eliminate any pairs that do not add up to 9 + y. For example, if y = 1, then the only possible pair for $B$ and $C$ is (2,10), which does not add up to 9 + 1 = 10. Therefore, we can eliminate y = 1 as a possibility. We can repeat this process for each possible value of y, until we find the value of y that gives us a valid pair for $B$ and $C$. Once we have determined the values of x and y, we can use them to find the number on edge $C D$. The number on edge $C D$ is simply the difference between the sum of the numbers on $C$ and $D$ and the sum of the numbers on $A$ and $B$, which is x - y. Therefore, the number on edge $C D$ is x - y. Finally, we can check our answer by making sure that the numbers on each edge add up to the correct sum. For example, the sum of the numbers on $A$ and $B$ is 9, the sum of the numbers on $A$ and $C$ is 9 + x, the sum of the numbers on $B$ and $C$ is 9 + y, and the sum of the numbers on $C$ and $D$ is x - y + 9.

For a hexagon, this means the sum of its interior angles is (6 - 2) × 180 = 4 × 180 = 720 degrees.\n\nSince there are six angles in a hexagon, we can divide the sum of the angles by the number of angles to find the average angle measure: 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum number of right angles (90 degrees) that can be present in a hexagon. Since the average angle measure is 120 degrees, it would not be possible for all six angles to be right angles because their sum would only be 540 degrees (6 × 90). However, we can try to maximize the number of right angles while still maintaining the 720-degree sum.\n\nIf we have two right angles (90 degrees each), their total would be 180 degrees. To make up the remaining 540 degrees, we need four more angles that are not right angles. These four angles could be any non-right angles as long as their sum equals 540 degrees. One way to achieve this is to have two angles measuring 135 degrees each and two angles measuring 120 degrees each:\n\n135 + 135 + 120 + 120 = 510 degrees\n\nAdding the two right angles (90 degrees) gives us a total of 600 degrees. To reach the required 720 degrees, we can add two more right angles:\n\n600 + 90 + 90 = 780 degrees\n\nThis is greater than the required 720 degrees, so we need to adjust one of the non-right angles. We can do this by reducing one of the 135-degree angles to 120 degrees:\n\n120 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 90 + 90 = 720 degrees\n\nSo, the maximum number of right angles in a hexagon is \\boxed{2}.", "model_answer": "2", "correct": false}

Since the plane is tiled by squares and pentagons, the total area is just the sum of the areas of all the squares and pentagons. Let's call the side length of the square tiles \"s\".

Since there are $13$ ways to do this, there are $13$ times as many paths from $A$ to $L$ using $13$ edges as there are paths from $A$ to $L$ using $12$ edges.\n\nSo, we seek the number of paths from $A$ to $L$ using exactly $12$ edges. We will use the following result:\n\n**Result 1**: The number of paths from a vertex $v$ to a vertex $w$ using exactly $k$ edges is equal to the number of paths from $v$ to $w$ using exactly $k-1$ edges plus the number of paths from $v$ to $w$ using exactly $k-2$ edges.\n\nTo prove this, consider the last edge of a path from $v$ to $w$ using exactly $k$ edges.
