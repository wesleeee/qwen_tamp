Since $O$ is the intersection point of the diagonals, $OM$ is the height of triangle $AOC$.\n\n$AC = \\sqrt{2}s$ (diagonal of a square) and $OM = \\frac{s}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle $AOC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}s \\times \\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{s^2\\sqrt{2}}{4}$.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle $COD$, the base is $CD$ and the height is $OM$.\n\n$CD = s$ (side length of the square) and $OM = \\frac{s}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle $COD$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times s \\times \\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{s^2}{4}$.\n\nAdding the areas of triangle $AOC$ and triangle $COD$ together, we get the area of triangle $AOCD$ as $\\frac{s^2\\sqrt{2}}{4} + \\frac{s^2}{4} = \\frac{s^2(\\sqrt{2} + 1)}{4}$.\n\nNow, to find the ratio of the area of $AOCD$ to the area of $ABCD$, we divide the area of $AOCD$ by the area of $ABCD$:\n\n$\\frac{\\frac{s^2(\\sqrt{2} + 1)}{4}}{s^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} + 1}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of $AOCD$ to the area of $ABCD$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2} + 1}{4}}$.", "model_answer": "\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{4}", "correct": false}
