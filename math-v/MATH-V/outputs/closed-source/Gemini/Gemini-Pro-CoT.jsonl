We can divide the glass into two parts: a rectangular prism and a triangular prism. The rectangular prism has a volume of \\(3 \\pi h\\), just like the upright glass. The triangular prism has a base area of \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\pi = \\frac{3}{2} \\pi\\) and a height of \\(h\\), so its volume is \\(\\frac{3}{2} \\pi h\\).\n\nAdding the volumes of the two parts, we get the total volume of water in the leaning glass: \\(3 \\pi h + \\frac{3}{2} \\pi h = \\frac{9}{2} \\pi h\\).\n\nSince the water level is the same in both glasses, we know that \\(\\frac{9}{2} \\pi h = 3 \\pi h\\).

For example, code 112 is confusing because it could refer to floor 11 and room 2 or floor 1 and room 12.\n\nTo find the number of confusing codes, we can first count the number of codes where the floor number and the room number have the same digits. There are 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), so there are 10 possibilities for the floor number and 10 possibilities for the room number. This gives us 10 * 10 = 100 possible codes where the floor number and the room number have the same digits.\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the number of codes where the floor number and the room number are the same, as these codes are not confusing. There are 10 possible codes where the floor number and the room number are the same (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 00).\n\nTherefore, the number of confusing codes is 100 - 10 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}", "model_answer": "90", "correct": false}

In order to find the side of the great white square, we need to know the length of the side of the small white square. The area of the great white square is equal to the area of the small white square plus the area of the grey square. The area of the grey square is 8 * 8 = 64. The area of the small white square is s * s, where s is the length of the side of the small white square. The area of the great white square is (s + 8) * (s + 8). We know that the area of the great white square is equal to the area of the small white square plus the area of the grey square, so we can write the equation (s + 8) * (s + 8) = s * s + 64. We can solve this equation for s by expanding the left side and simplifying: s^2 + 16s + 64 = s^2 + 64. We can then subtract s^2 from both sides of the equation to get 16s = 0. We can then divide both sides of the equation by 16 to get s = 0. Therefore, the side of the small white square is 0. This is impossible, because the side of a square cannot be 0. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{None of the above}.", "model_answer": "noneoftheabove", "correct": false}

The point $A$ has coordinates $(1,1)$ and the point $B$ has coordinates $(5,5)$.\n\nWe can think of the problem as finding a path from $(1,1)$ to $(5,5)$ in a grid with obstacles. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let $dp[i][j]$ be the number of shortest paths from $(1,1)$ to $(i,j)$. We can initialize $dp[1][1] = 1$ and $dp[i][j] = 0$ for all other $i$ and $j$.\n\nFor each grid point $(i,j)$, we can consider the following cases:\n\n* If $(i,j)$ is an obstacle, then $dp[i][j] = 0$.\n* If $(i,j)$ is not an obstacle, then $dp[i][j]$ can be reached from $(i-1,j)$ or $(i,j-1)$. Therefore, $dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]$.\n\nWe can compute $dp[i][j]$ for all $i$ and $j$ in $O(mn)$ time.

In order to find the length of a side of the octagon, we first need to find the length of the hypotenuse of one of the right triangles that was cut off. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to do this. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
